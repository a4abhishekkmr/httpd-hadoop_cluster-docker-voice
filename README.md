#httpd-Hadoop_cluster-docker-with voice touch output#
===============================================================

Written a python code for Linux which will do some taska like making
cluster of HAdoop distributive file system, docker operations, and some linux commands.

You just have to choose "lw" as Password
choose remote login or local login
In Local login, the commands will run on oS based on local syatem(linux)
while in Remote login it needs Ipv4 of another linux OS, then it's 
password for authentication' and then you are ready to do tasks.

Now, you need to have a setup of hadoop cluster to just have a conncetion and 
to check conncetion as master node or data node.

Now, for docker, you need to installl docker first, INstallation is quite easy, it's 5 minutes task.

You can find repo of installation of docker in my repo list.


Here are some of the command, which is going to be done in this code.

I had disabled the while loop option you can continue that one by removing 
the # and unmaking that as a comment.
MAke sure of intendement of lines after while loop as python code needs only
preety intended lines instead of brackets.

press 2 : to cal
press 3 : to reboot
press 4 : to configure webserver
press 5 : to check the ststus of the webserver
